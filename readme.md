This is a starter project for the [Chris Courses Online Multiplayer Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcvqnx14cZA) available on YouTube.

To get started, download this repo and double click `index.html` to see the single-player game we'll base our multiplayer-game off of.


Nodemon= automatically refreshes server
saves time to log out after changes

install node and nodemon
install socket io
npm install socket.io@4.6.1 --save-exact
//to save in package.jsin
npm install -g to save in master
//does not include in package.json



We are using Express in tandem with HTTP

express already has a server, but socket .io require a HTTP server, not a express server
